                <p>If there is one thing I have learned from Sport is the ability of players to visualize their Goal.
                    Their ability to not only master their skills by physically practicing but also mentally rehearsing it too.
                    My friend, brain is so naive that have hard time differentiating between reality and imagination, but then again I have had dreams which seemed more realistic than this reality so I am not sure if I even understand what is reality. Inception!!. Three groups were told to practice playing piano for 5 days. Group one practiced actual Piano, Group two was told to practice in their mind, and group three was just a control group. They did not have to do anything just watch Movies all day.
                    All volunteer’s brains were scanned each day in the region connected to the finger muscles.
                    Top two rows are showing the changes in the brain in those who played the notes, middle two are for those who simply imagined playing the notes.
                    If we compare both groups with the third group, we can see that changes in the brain in those who imagined playing piano are same as in those who actually played piano.
                    I guess we can say, we can fool our Brain. There are many studies on internet which can prove how Mental Imaginary can be used to harness our ability to achieve whatever we want but the best way to figure it out is by experimenting with it.</p>
